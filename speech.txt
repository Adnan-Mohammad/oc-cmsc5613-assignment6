Fans, for the past two weeks you have been reading about a bad break. Yet today I 
consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth. I have been in ballparks 
for 17  years and have never received anything but kindness and encouragement from you 
fans ….“So I close in saying that I may have had a tough break, but I have an awful lot 
to live for.
